# TippsySake Budgeting Application

Welcome to the TippsySake Budgeting Application development challenge! In this challenge, you will be tasked with building a full-stack budgeting application using NextJS and Typescript. The application should fulfill specific requirements outlined below, and you will have one week to complete the challenge.

## Project Overview

### Challenge Requirements
- Build a budgeting application using NextJS and Typescript.
- Utilize any tools/libraries for implementation, but ensure the application is written in NextJS.
- The application must include features such as charge input form, category creation form, spending chart, charge and category tables with pagination and sorting, and CRUD operations for charges and categories.
- Data persistence is required through some form of API or database integration.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality, style, and architecture.
- UI/UX design considerations.
- Maintainability of the codebase.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, follow these steps:

DB Used: (**Appwrite**)[https://appwrite.io/]

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and populate with your API keys


```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can begin editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About the Challenge

### Time Taken
